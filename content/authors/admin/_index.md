<p style='text-align: justify;'> <b>Greydon Gilmore</b> obtained a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at Western University (<a href="https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/8545/" target="_blank">Western thesis repository</a>). His thesis work involved the development of an open-source stereotactic planning software for functional neurosurgery. His primary research interests include cranial electrodes inserted for movement disorders and epilepsy. The goal is to improve surgical targetting accuracy and post-operative localization of electrodes.</p>
