    "# Generalizing to different populations\n",

    "The fact that the learning curve shows a convergence between the training and test samples (at least when our sample is larger) provides some assurance that our model will continue to perform comparably well when tested on new observations sampled from the same population. This does *not*, however, mean that performance will remain comparable when tested on new *populations*. If our goal is to generalize beyond the population we sampled from in our training sample, it's advisable to compute validation curves that evaluate generalization performance in as realistic a way as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we intend to apply our age-prediction model to countries that are undersampled in our existing data (or not sampled at all), we might want to quantify how well the model generalizes across countries that *are* adequately sampled. Let's take a look at the country representation in our Johnson (2014) dataset:"

    "Does this mean that the relationship between personality and age genuinely varies across age, or is this simply a reliability issue—i.e., that we shouldn't trust personality scores on an English-language measure when provided by non-native English speakers? The above results don't directly tell us (though the fact that our age prediction model is useless even in Singapore, a country with high English literacy, might push us to suspect the former). We could of course pursue this question further—for example, by reversing our approach and training the model on non-English speakers, or by conducting an item analysis to see if we can identify items that substantially change their predictive value across cultures.\n",

    "In any case, the main point should hopefully be clear: it's a bad idea to assume that a particular pattern or prediction (even an extremely strong one, as in this case!) is going to generalize to different contexts. Fortunately, as long as we have data that spans multiple contexts, common cross-validation strategies allow us to directly estimate the generalizability of our model, rather than taking it as an article of faith."
