	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), applying chronic electrical stimulation of subcortical structures, is a clinical intervention applied in major neurologic disorders. In order to achieve a good clinical effect, accurate electrode placement is necessary. The primary localisation is typically based on presurgical MRI imaging, often followed by intra-operative electrophysiology recording to increase the accuracy and to compensate for brain shift, especially in cases where the surgical target is small, and there is low contrast: e.g., in Parkinson's disease (PD) and in its common target, the subthalamic nucleus (STN).
METHODS: We propose a novel, fully automatic method for intra-operative surgical navigation. First, the surgical target is segmented in presurgical MRI images using a statistical shape-intensity model. Next, automated alignment with intra-operatively recorded microelectrode recordings is performed using a probabilistic model of STN electrophysiology. We apply the method to a dataset of 120 PD patients with clinical T2 1.5T images, of which 48 also had available microelectrode recordings (MER).
RESULTS: The proposed segmentation method achieved STN segmentation accuracy around dice = 0.60 compared to manual segmentation. This is comparable to the state-of-the-art on low-resolution clinical MRI data. When combined with electrophysiology-based alignment, we achieved an accuracy of 0.85 for correctly including recording sites of STN-labelled MERs in the final STN volume.
CONCLUSION: The proposed method combines image-based segmentation of the subthalamic nucleus with microelectrode recordings to estimate their mutual location during the surgery in a fully automated process. Apart from its potential use in clinical targeting, the method can be used to map electrophysiological properties to specific parts of the basal ganglia structures and their vicinity.},
