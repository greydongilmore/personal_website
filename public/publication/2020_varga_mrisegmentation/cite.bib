	abstract = {Identiﬁcation of subcortical structures is an essential step in surgical planning for interventions such as the deep brain stimulation (DBS), in which permanent electrode is implanted in a precisely deﬁned location. For reﬁnement of the target localisation and compensation of brain shift occurring during the surgery, intra-operative electrophysiological recording using microelectrodes is usually undertaken.},
