	abstract = {BACKGROUND Parkinson disease (PD) patients have turning impairments that may increase fall risk. Clinics lack specialized kinematic equipment used in gait and turn analysis and require a simple method to evaluate fall risk and advise patients in turning strategy selection. OBJECTIVES To enhance understanding of PD turning strategies and determine if turning can be assessed using a video-recording and categorization method, we compared 180-degree and 90-degree turns as a function of medication status and dual-tasking (DT). METHODS 21 PD participants (H\&Y stage 1-3) in PD-ON and PD-OFF medication states and 16 controls completed 180-degree and 90-degree turn-tasks with and without DT. Video-recordings of tasks permitted classification of 180-degree turns into Few-Step turns (FST) vs. Multi-Step turns (MST) and 90-degree turns into Step vs. Spin-turns. FST were further sub-classified into Twisting vs. Sideways turns and MST into Backward, Festination, Forward or Wheeling turns. Percentages of subtypes were analyzed across groups by task. RESULTS IN 180-degree tasks, there was an effect of group: FST vs. MST F(2,55) = 9.578, p {\textless} .001. PD participants in the off-medication state (PD-OFF) produced significantly more MST with a larger number of different turning subtypes vs. controls or PD on medication (PD-ON). In 90-degree tasks, controls significantly increased their proportion of Step-turns while DT (p {\textless} .001), an adaptation not observed in PD-ON or PD-OFF. CONCLUSIONS PD turning impairments may stem from an inability to select a unified turning strategy and to adapt to the turning environment, which may be exacerbated in PD-OFF. Video-analysis may prove beneficial in predicting a clinical course for PD patients by revealing features of turning dysfunction.},
